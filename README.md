# flux-analyze
Analysis and recovery of IBM MFM floppy image data

This is where I experiment with methods to more reliably decode IBM MFM floppies
based on flux transition data.

Currently, mfm_decoder contains some functions for doing so, based on the .au
format that FluxEngine exposes through fluxtoau. The main idea is to use the
optimal 1D k-median algorithm of Gr√∏nlund et al. 2017 to separate different
clock tracks in the presence of noise. More info can be found in the source
files' comments.

To use, run mfm_decoder interactively in ipython, i.e. `ipython3 -i mfm_decoder.py`, then invoke `demonstrate("your-file.au")`

The tracks/ directory contains some sample tracks, all compressed with bz2.
(Uncompress before using.)

- low_level_format_with_noise: every sector is 0x00 or 0xF6. Some weird effects on the flux transitions in certain places. Useful for testing recovery ideas later.
- MS_Plus_OK_track - OK track from a Microsoft Plus! floppy. This one can be decoded fine with FluxEngine (given the source data this .au is from)
- MS_Plus_warped_track - Warped track from a Microsoft Plus! floppy. FluxEngine can't cleanly decode every sector, but mfm_decoder can.
