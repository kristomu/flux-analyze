# flux-analyze
Analysis and recovery of IBM MFM floppy image data

This is where I experiment with methods to more reliably decode IBM MFM floppies
based on flux transition data.

Currently, mfm_decoder contains some functions for doing so, based on the .au
format that FluxEngine exposes through fluxtoau. The main idea is to use an
optimal O(kn log n) 1D k-median algorithm, referenced in Gr√∏nlund et al. 2017,
to separate different clock tracks in the presence of noise. More info can be
found in the source files' comments.

To use, run mfm_decoder interactively in ipython, i.e. `ipython3 -i mfm_decoder.py`, then invoke `demonstrate("your-file.au")`

## Experimental local dewarping

mfm_decoder also contains functions to do a sliding window k-medians-based
correction of jitter/warping. This makes sectors easier to read in some cases,
and could potentially recover data from fragile disks where every read counts.
However, it is slow at the moment.

`demonstrate()` demonstrates the dewarping functionality, and passing
`show_plot=True` will show some before-and after plots, like this:
