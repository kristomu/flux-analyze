# vhdl

This directory contains some VHDL code from https://pastebin.com/w0S40FV3
by Mostafa Abd El-Aziz, licensed under the GPLv3. This code implements a
floppy drive controller.

The pll.txt is my understanding of the logic of the phase-locked loop
component of this code, which, if the VHDL code is accurate, represents
how an actual floppy drive does dewarping.
